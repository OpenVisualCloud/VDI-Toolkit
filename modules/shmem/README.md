# Share memory samples via IVSHMEM

The shmem module enables share memory mechanism via IVSHMEM between host and guest VMs to perform multiple applications, such as screen capture and encoding.

From v23.12 release, we take screen memory sharing as a main example to utilize IVSHMEM-plain mechanism. For detail guidance, please refer to [Host guidance](host/README.md) and [Guest VM guidance](guestVMs/README.md).
